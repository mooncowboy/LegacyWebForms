## Analysis
The upgrade to the new .NET framework involves several key changes across all selected projects. These changes aim to modernize the projects, ensure compatibility with the new framework, and address potential issues arising from the upgrade. Below is a summary of the proposed changes:

### SDK Installation and Configuration
- Validate that the required SDK for the upgrade is installed on the machine. If not, assist in its installation.
- Ensure that the SDK version specified in `global.json` files is compatible with the new framework.

### Project File and Target Framework Updates
- Convert project files to the SDK-style format, which is required for modern .NET framework projects.
- Update the project's target framework(s) to the new version: `.NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2 -> net9.0`. In some cases, projects may target multiple frameworks post-upgrade (e.g., Windows, iOS, Android) if they utilize platform-specific features.

### NuGet Package Updates
- **Incompatible Packages**: Replace or remove NuGet packages that are incompatible with the new target framework. If no supported version exists, alternative packages must be used, and corresponding code must be updated to align with the new APIs. Examples include:
  - `Microsoft.AspNet.FriendlyUrls, 1.0.2`: No supported version found.
  - `Microsoft.AspNet.ScriptManager.MSAjax, 5.0.0`: No supported version found.
  - `Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization, 1.1.3`: No supported version found.
- **Recommended Upgrades**: Upgrade NuGet packages to versions compatible with the new framework. For example:
  - `Antlr, 3.5.0.2 -> Antlr4, 4.6.6`.
- **Framework-Included Functionality**: Remove NuGet packages whose functionality is now included in the framework. For example:
  - `Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform, 2.0.1`: Package functionality included with new framework reference.
  - `Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure, 2.0.0`: Package functionality included with new framework reference.

### Code Updates
- Update code to resolve breaking changes caused by changes in project dependencies or the use of alternative NuGet packages. This includes adapting to new APIs and ensuring compatibility with the updated framework.

### Important Note on Breaking Changes
Changes to project dependencies, such as replacing or upgrading NuGet packages, may introduce breaking changes in the code. These issues will be identified and resolved during the upgrade process to ensure a smooth transition to the new framework.
